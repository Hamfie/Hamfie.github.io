              Hi there! I’m Hannah Ashna. I’m a gamer at heart and it’s one of the primary reasons aside from my love for programming that led me to pursue my Computer Science (Games Tech) degree. 
              <br><br>Right now I’m a first year student at Nottingham Trent University and it has been going great so far. I’ve met a lot of interesting people over the last few months and look forward to meeting more over my next four years here. Most of my social media handles do a pretty good job of expressing who I am but if you’re a little lazy (I totally get it), I can summarise a few things for you.	
              <br><br>I’m a 20 year old international student from Malaysia. I spent a little bit of my childhood in a small town an hour away from Kuala Lumpur. At the age of 12 I moved to Dubai, U.A.E. to live with my mom. I’ve had quite a few interesting adventures while studying in Dubai. Here’s a few of them:

              <li>In 2015 I was placed in the Top-Five Debaters from the Middle East Category at a Debating competition.</li>
              <li>Participated and worked in the committee for several Model United Nations (MUN) events.</li>
              <li>I became a public speaker and mental health advocate. </li>
              <li>I helped co-direct and stage manage several productions for my high school’s Performing Arts department.</li>
              <li>I held multiple roles within the student council</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

                  I thoroughly enjoy exploring various fields and subject areas, even if they don’t have any relation to computer science. It’s one of the reasons why I’ve been a student volunteer at Logisym Malaysia for almost 4 years now. It started as a way for me to better understand what my mom does and it has now turned into a side-interest of mine.
                  <br><br>P.s. In case you’re looking to get to know me a little more, I’ve added a couple of photographs to help (Hopefully they aren’t too weird).
